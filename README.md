- 👋 Hi, I’m Mahesh and I am a graduate student/researcher.
- 👀 I’m interested in applied mathematics with a concentration on computational aspects, particularly control theory(focused on inventory control), machine learning, and differential and mean field games. Also, I have developed a keen interest in data science and analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for data science, and numerical methods with Matlab other than my other academic work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project related to control theory, machine learning, data science, numerical solutions to ODEs, etc.
- 📫 How to reach me: work email: mkr200000@utdallas.edu
